# PyBer Ride-Sharing Data Analysis
## Overview
The goal of the analysis is to enable PyBer's CEO to better understand PyBer's ride-sharing data across the different city types - Rural, Suburban, and Urban so that she can strategize appropriately for PyBer's future.

## Results

Upon summarizing Pyber's ride-sharing data across the city type, we can see that urban-dwellers are over ten times more likely to take PyBers than people who live in rural areas. Suburbanites are also not very inclined to take PyBers. In 2019, suburbanites only accounted for about 26% of the total rides for the year.

Similar trends are witnessed across all aspects of our analysis. Urban areas have 2,405 drivers, whereas rural areas only have 78 drivers. Accordingly, the total fares across the city types differ greatly as well. PyBer drew in total fares of almost $40,000 in urban areas, half as much from suburban riders, and only about a tenth as much (about $4,000) from rural riders.

Rural PyBer drivers on the other hand rake in higher average fares than urban drivers. However, with the very low ridership in rural areas, the higher average fare is unlikely to compensate for the lack of volume. 

On the flip side, rural riders pay more per ride than urban riders - about $10 more. The expensive rides might be deterrent enough to discourage rural riders from hiring PyBer in the future.

### Seasonality
In order to see if we can identify seasonality of PyBer rides, we have graphed the fares earned from each of the three city types from 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019.
