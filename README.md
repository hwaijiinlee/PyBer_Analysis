# PyBer Ride-Sharing Data Analysis
## Overview
The goal of the analysis is to enable PyBer's CEO to better understand PyBer's ride-sharing data across the different city types - Rural, Suburban, and Urban so that she can strategize appropriately for PyBer's future.

## Results

Upon summarizing Pyber's ride-sharing data across the city type, we can see that urban-dwellers are over ten times more likely to take PyBers than people who live in rural areas. Suburbanites are also not very inclined to take PyBers. In 2019, suburbanites only accounted for about 26% of the total rides for the year.

Similar trends are witnessed across all aspects of our analysis. Urban areas have 2,405 drivers, whereas rural areas only have 78 drivers. Accordingly, the total fares across the city types differ greatly as well. PyBer drew in total fares of almost $40,000 in urban areas, half as much from suburban riders, and only about a tenth as much (about $4,000) from rural riders.

Rural PyBer drivers on the other hand rake in higher average fares than urban drivers, almost $40 more! However, with the very low ridership in rural areas, the higher average fare is unlikely to compensate for the lack of volume. 

Accordingly, rural riders pay more per ride than urban riders - about $10 more. The expensive rides might be deterrent enough to discourage rural riders from hiring PyBer in the future.

### Seasonality
In order to see if we can identify seasonality of PyBer rides, we have graphed the total fares earned from each of the three city types from 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019.

Fares from urban riders seem to fluctuate a fair amount especially between March'19 and April'19. Fares from suburban riders seem less volatile with the exception of a peak towards the end of February. Fares from rural riders also appear less volatile with only two main peaks towards the end of February and at the beginning of April.

Interestingly, all three city types share the same peak (of varying magnitude) towards the end of February. Might weather be the reason for the spike in ridership around that time?

## Conclusion and Recommendations
Looking at the analysis, we can draw a firm conclusion that the future of PyBer rests in how we position and market ourselves to urban riders as well as urban drivers. The ridership and total fares earned from urban rides are so much higher than rural areas that it might be worth considering focusing all our efforts in promoting PyBer to urban areas only.

Although we see some degree of volatility in fares earned from urban rides, the overall ridership and drivers available in urban areas are so much more favorable than suburban and rural areas. In time to come, as PyBer gets more established and popular among riders, the hope is that such volatility will be greatly reduced.
